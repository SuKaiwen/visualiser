# Visualiser

A React application that helps visualise the dynamic programming solution to the longest increasing subsequence problem. Simply type in numbers in the input box and press submit to add that number to the array. 

Note 1: Due to constraints I have limited the valid numbers to be between -999999 and 999999 to avoid integer overflow. I have also limited the array to a max of 12 for easy visualisation purposes (the solution/code will visualise up to an infinite amount of numbers however it would look pretty dumb). 

Note 2: I may implement other visualisations to cool problems in the future!
